This is the README file for the HeadFirstJava project. The goal of this project is to go through the Head First Java book and have most of the programs
(both from examples inside the chapters, and from the exercises at the end of these same chapters) in one location. This will be an occasion to practice
using Git and it will be something that can serve as a portefolio to show potential customer or employer (at least, that is a start).

The project is divided in sub-folders that represent the different chapters of the book.
